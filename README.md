# Modelling Workplace Stress and Health Behaviours Using R

This project, completed as part of STAT 464: Statistical Computing with R at the University of Ghana, explores how demographic and occupational factors influence stress levels, health behaviours, and healthcare utilisation.

## 📊 Project Overview
The dataset (`Work.csv`) includes demographic and work-related variables such as age, income, hours worked, stress levels, and smoking status. The analysis combines exploratory data analysis, regression modelling, and predictive analytics to understand drivers of workplace stress and health outcomes.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Compare average income across gender groups using hypothesis testing.
- Build a logistic regression model to predict **high stress** using age, income, hours worked, and smoking status.
- Fit a linear model predicting **sick days** from stress level, income, and smoking behavior.
- Evaluate model accuracy using a confusion matrix.

## 🧩 Key Insights
- Significant gender-based income differences observed.
- Smoking status and long work hours were key predictors of high stress.
- Stress levels strongly associated with increased sick days.
